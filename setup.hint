sdesc: "GPG commandline wrapper which uses gnome-keyring"
ldesc: "gnome-gpg is is a simple commandline wrapper around gpg that
makes it store its passphrase in gnome-keyring.  It is a direct
competitor to (the unmaintained) quintuple-agent.

It is not a keyring management program or anything like that, and
has no plans to become one."
